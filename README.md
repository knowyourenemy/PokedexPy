# PokedexPy
This is a Python program that allows users to retrieve information about Pokemons. It uses [This Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/).

## How to use
Ensure you have pip and python installed. 
```
pip install requests
python pokemon.py
```
## Future plans
1. Modify code to allow type-checking
2. Allow user to retrieve more information
3. Include tests
4. (If I am ambitious) add a frontend component that includes styled pages and images
